# anomaly-faction-economy

## Features:

* Traders now have different discounts based on the relations of your and their faction.
* Prices scale with reputation of actor.
* Prices for your faction scale based on goodwill (reputation you gain for quests).
* Prices scale with location, the more northern it is - the higher the deficit (and so are the prices).
* Other factions now sell their gear only after you reach certain goodwill level with them.
* Trader of your faction now sells more items with certain chance.
* Ammo spawns based on weapons in stock.
* Configs in MCM for all of the above
